Chickenputty has become a constant source of frustration at PS99. Their unprofessional behavior disrupts both staff and students, making the learning environment unbearable. Constant tardiness, disrespectful remarks, and failure to complete tasks on time highlight a disregard for the school's values. This ongoing pattern negatively impacts everyone, creating unnecessary stress and hindering progress. For the sake of the school's harmony and productivity, itâ€™s imperative that Chickenputty is held accountable for their actions and dismissed. PS99 deserves a more respectful and dedicated team member.
